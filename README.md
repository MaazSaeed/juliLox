### Part II of *Crafting Interpreters* - Translating jlox (Java-lox) to julilox (Julia-lox)

The purpose of this project is threefold:
1. To explore advanced features of Julia, such as metaprogramming.
2. Since Julia follows a different paradigm than Java, translating to Julia requires a deep understanding of the original Java implementation before converting it.
3. To learn how to build a complete scripting language from scratch, without relying on external tools or dependencies. While the language may be slower in execution speed, the implementation is both correct and comprehensive.

In the future, I hope to also translate Part III of *Crafting Interpreters* (perhaps to Rust or C for added rigor), which involves reimplementing Lox in C as "clox" to make it faster and more competitive with languages like Python, Lua, and JavaScript.
